The instruction set of JOP, the so-called microcode, is described in
this appendix. Each instruction consists of a single instruction
word (8 bits) without extra operands and executes in a single
cycle\footnote{The only multicycle instruction is \codefoot{wait}
and depends on the access time of the external memory}.
\tablename~\ref{tab:appendix:hwreg} lists the registers and internal
memory areas that are used in the dataflow description.

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Name & Description \\
    \midrule
    A & Top of the stack\\
    B & The element one below the top of stack\\
    stack[] & The stack buffer for the rest of the stack\\
    sp & The stack pointer for the stack buffer\\
    vp & The variable pointer. Points to the first local in
    the stack buffer\\
    ar & Address register for indirect stack access\\
    pc & Microcode program counter\\
    jpc & Program counter for the Java bytecode\\
    opd & 8 bit operand from the bytecode fetch unit\\
    opd$_{16}$ & 16 bit operand from the bytecode fetch unit\\
    memrda & Read address register of the memory subsystem\\
    memwra & Write address register of the memory subsystem\\
    memrdd & Read data register of the memory subsystem\\
    memwrd & Write data register of the memory subsystem\\
    mula, mulb & Operands of the hardware multiplier\\
    mulr & Result register of the hardware multiplier\\
    membcr & Bytecode address and length register of the memory
    subsystem\\
    bcstart & Method start address register in the method cache\\
	memidx & Index register for native field access \\
