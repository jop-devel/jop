SimpCon \cite{simpcon} is the main interconnection interface used for
JOP. The I/O modules and the main memory are connected via this
standard. In the following chapter an introduction to SimpCon is
presented.

The VHDL files in \dirent{vhdl/scio} are SimpCon I/O components
(e.g.\ \code{sc\_uart.vhd} is a simple UART) and SimpCon I/O
configurations. The I/O configurations define the I/O devices and the
address mapping for a JOP system. All those configurations start with
\code{scio\_}. The I/O components start with \code{sc\_}.
Configuration \code{scio\_min} contains the minimal I/O components
for a JOP system: the system module \code{sc\_sys.vhd} and a UART
\code{sc\_uart.vhd} for program download and basic communication
(\code{System.in} and \code{System.out}).

The system module \code{sc\_sys.vhd} contains the clock counter, the
$\mu$s counter, timer interrupt, the SW interrupt, exception
interrupts, the watchdog port, and the connection to the
multiprocessor synchronization unit (\code{cmpsync.vhd}).

In directory \dirent{vhdl/memory} the memory controller
\code{mem\_sc.vhd} is a SimpCon master that can be connected to
various SRAM memory controllers \code{sc\_sram*.vhd}. Other memory
controller (e.g.\ the free Altera SDRAM interface) can be connected
via SimpCon bridges to Avalon, Wishbone, and AHB slaves (available in
\dirent{vhdl/simpcon}).
