/* The purpose of this class is to permit printing of debug messages with
 * callsigns (byte arrays) and floating point data from a no-heap thread.
 * With standard Java ways of doing this, we get MemoryAccessError due to
 * the internal use of ThreadLocal by Sun RTS for character encoders/decoders
 * (and possibly other things). With encoders/decoders, lazy initialisation
 * leads to uncontrolled allocation w.r.t. to scope. Most likely the problem
 * is that the thread locals get allocated on the heap.
 */

/* Note that these converters are intentionally incorrect. We have no control
 * over the use of thread locals in VM libraries, so these may not work / not
 * be needed on other VMs.
