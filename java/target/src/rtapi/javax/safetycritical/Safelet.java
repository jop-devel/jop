/**
 * The interface that represents the SCJ application.
 * 
 * A safety-critical application consists of one or more missions, executed
 * concurrently or in sequence. Every safety-critical application is represented
 * by an implementation of Safelet which identifies the outer-most
 * MissionSequencer. This outer-most MissionSequencer takes responsibility for
 * running the sequence of missions that comprise this safety-critical
 * application. The mechanism used to identify the Safelet to a particular SCJ
 * environment is implementation defined. For the MissionSequencer returned from
 * getSequencer, the SCJ infrastructure arranges for an independent thread to
 * begin executing the code for that sequencer and then waits for that thread to
 * terminate its execution.
